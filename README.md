# ME333-report-project
Mechatronics merges mechanics, electronics, computing and control to optimize machines; the course trains mechanical/robotic undergraduates in its principles and design for later specialisation.The project goal of this lesson is to build a complete vision-based navigation system around the STM32F767 controller and the K230 module.
